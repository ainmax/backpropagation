# backpropagation
Basic backpropagation method implementation for learning purposes.

Development history:
1) Neural network model created.
2) Trainer entity created.
3) Debugging...
4) Some stupid bugs fixed. Still doesn't work.
5) Debugging...
6) More stupid bugs fixed. And it works! But...
7) Training works really strange and randomly.
8) Thinking what wrong...
9) Understanding that code is a piece of sh...
10) Code rewriting...
11) Unit tests writing...
12) Um... What the hell is written there?..
13) Bug with biases gradient calculating fixed.
14) Debugging...
15) Holy sh.... It works! I trained neural network!!!
